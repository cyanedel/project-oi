# Ordinary Icons
They're just ordinary icons. Nothing worth mentioning.

## Basic Usage
```
<html>
<head>
	<!-- include main js file in head -->
	<script src='ordinary-icons.js'></script>
</head>
<body>
	<!-- pick which icon to use -->
	<div data-oi-regular="circle" size="64"></div>
</body>
<!-- execute to replace defined HTML elements with SVG icon -->
<script>oi.replace()</script>
</html>
```

## Icon list
Open `icon-list.html` in browser.
